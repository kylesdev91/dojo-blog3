                    an African-American man who was killed by police during an arrest in
                    Minneapolis on May 25, 2020. Protests in response to both Floyd's
                    death, and more broadly to police violence against other black people,
                    quickly spread across the United States and internationally.

                    Floyd grew up in Houston, Texas. He excelled in football and played
                    other sports throughout high school and college. Called "Perry" by his
                    friends and family, Floyd was characterized by people who knew him as
                    a "gentle giant." A blue-collar worker, Floyd was also an early
                    contributor to the development of Houston's hip-hop scene and a mentor
                    who was active in his religious community. Later, he faced several
                    arrests for theft and drug possession; in 2009, he made a plea deal
                    for an armed robbery, serving four years in prison.

                    In 2014, he moved to the Minneapolis, Minnesota area, finding work
                    both as a truck driver and a bouncer. In 2020, he lost his security
                    job because of the COVID-19 pandemic. He died after being arrested for
                    allegedly using counterfeit money to buy cigarettes; during the
                    arrest, Derek Chauvin, a white police officer, knelt on his neck and
                    back for eight minutes and 46 seconds, leading to his death. Events of
                    his arrest, death, and the actions of the officers have led to
                    international Black Lives Matter protests, calls for police reform,
                    and legislation to address perceived racial inequalities.

            <p>On February 23, 2020, Ahmaud Marquez Arbery, an unarmed 25-year-old African-American man, was fatally shot near Brunswick in Glynn County, Georgia, while jogging on Holmes Road just before the intersection with Satilla Drive in the Satilla Shores neighborhood.[1] Arbery had been pursued and confronted by two white residents, Travis McMichael and his father Gregory, who were armed and driving a pickup truck.[2] The event was recorded on video by a third Satilla Shores resident, William "Roddie" Bryan, who was following Arbery in a second vehicle.[3][4] The death and events following the investigation have sparked debates about the lack of racial equality, and have been reported internationally.</p>

            <p>The Glynn County Police Department (GCPD) said the Brunswick District Attorney's Office advised them on February 23 to make no arrests,[5] while the Brunswick District Attorney's Office denied that such advice was given to the GCPD by either the Brunswick District Attorney or her Assistant District Attorneys.[6] On February 24, Waycross Judicial Circuit District Attorney George Barnhill, who had not yet been assigned to the case, advised the GCPD that no arrests should be made.[7][8] Barnhill officially took over the case on February 27.[8] On April 2, Barnhill again advised the GCPD to make no arrests, while announcing his intention to recuse from the case due to connections between Gregory McMichael and Barnhill's son.[8][9][10] Barnhill requested recusal on April 7.[8] The case was ultimately transferred to the Cobb County District Attorney's Office, the fourth prosecutor's office to handle the case.[11]</p>

            <p>At the behest of Gregory McMichael,[12] a local attorney provided a copy of the video of the shooting to local radio station WGIG, who posted it to their website on May 5.[13] The video went viral,[14] having also been posted on YouTube and Twitter.[15][16] Within hours, Durden said a grand jury would decide whether charges would be brought, and accepted an offer from Governor Brian Kemp to have the Georgia Bureau of Investigation (GBI) investigate the case.[15][17]</p>

            <p>On May 7, the GBI arrested the McMichaels and charged them with felony murder and aggravated assault.[18] On May 21, Bryan was arrested and charged with felony murder and attempted false imprisonment.[19][20] On June 4, additional evidence was presented by the prosecutor to support the murder charges, including a statement to the GBI by William Bryan that Travis McMichael said "fucking nigger" while standing over Arbery's body.[21] The alleged use of a racial slur could factor into a federal investigation looking into whether or not hate crime charges will be brought.[21]</p>

            <p>The fact that the McMichaels were not arrested until 74 days later, after the video went viral, sparked debates on racial profiling in America.[5][22] Numerous religious leaders, politicians, athletes, and other celebrities condemned the incident.[23] The GCPD and the Brunswick District Attorney's Office were nationally criticized for their handling of the case and the delayed arrests; Georgia Attorney General Christopher M. Carr formally requested the intervention of the FBI in the case on May 10, which the FBI granted the following day.</p>

            <p>On March 13, 2020, Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old African-American emergency medical technician, was fatally shot by Louisville Metro Police Department (LMPD) officers. Three LMPD officers forced entry into her apartment in Louisville, Kentucky, under the authority of a search warrant. Gunfire was exchanged between Taylor's boyfriend Kenneth Walker and the officers. Walker said he believed that the officers were intruders. The LMPD officers fired over twenty shots. Taylor was shot eight times[1] and LMPD sergeant Mattingly was injured by gunfire.[2] Another police officer and an LMPD lieutenant were on the scene when the warrant was executed.[3]</p>

            <p>The LMPD investigation was searching for two people who were already in police custody[4] and suspected of selling controlled substances from a drug house more than 10 miles (16 km) away.[5] One of the people in custody, Jamarcus Glover, had a prior relationship with Taylor.[6] The search warrant included Taylor's residence because it was suspected of receiving drugs in the case[5] and because a car registered to Taylor had been seen parked on several occasions in front of Glover's house.[7] No drugs were found in the apartment.</p>

            <p>Walker was licensed to carry a firearm and fired first, injuring a law enforcement officer, whereupon police returned fire into the apartment with more than 20 rounds. According to a wrongful death lawsuit filed against the police by the Taylor family's attorney, the officers entered the home without knocking or announcing that they were police officers, and allegedly opened fire "with a total disregard for the value of human life."[8][9]</p>

            <p>On the night of February 26, 2012, in Sanford, Florida, United States, George Zimmerman fatally shot Trayvon Martin, a 17-year-old African-American high school student. Zimmerman, a 28-year-old man of mixed race,[Note 1] was the neighborhood watch coordinator for his gated community where Martin was visiting his relatives at the time of the shooting.[3][4][5] Zimmerman shot Martin, who was unarmed, during a physical altercation between the two. Zimmerman, injured during the encounter, claimed self-defense in the confrontation.</p>

  <p>In a widely reported trial, Zimmerman was charged with murder for Martin's death, but acquitted at trial after claiming self-defense. The incident was reviewed by the Department of Justice for potential civil rights violations, but no additional charges were filed, citing insufficient evidence</p>

            <p>At about 7:15 p.m., authorities received a call about a black male wearing a bandanna and hoodie waving a gun in a parking lot. Officers say they told Spencer several times to stop walking away from them, but he would not, according to police. Police say there were two attempts to tase Spencer, but neither were effective. Two officers fired shots at Spencer after they say he turned toward them. The weapon, which turned out to be a BB gun, was still in Spencer's hand when he was shot, according to police. He was shot twice: once in the hip area and once in the collarbone. He later died at a hospital.[4]</p>

      <p>VALLEJO — The city of Vallejo has released four videos showing a resident pulling a gun on an off-duty cop as the two argued over a parking space, then running away as the officer draws his own weapon and continuously fires, killing him.</p>

<p>The fatal Nov. 10 encounter has led to protests and threats of a lawsuit by the family of Eric “Cheddaman” Reason, 38, who was slain by off-duty Richmond police Sgt. Virgil Thomas, a 27-year veteran. The shooting occurred at the parking lot of JJ’s Fish and Chicken, near the intersection of Fairgrounds and Sereno drives.</p>

      Around 12:17 p.m. on Monday, police responded to the area of Old Pascagoula Road and Roundtree Court for a report of several burglaries in the area and the suspect impeding the flow of traffic.

When officers arrived, they tried to take the suspect, later identified as 36-year-old Christopher McCorvey, into custody but he resisted. The officers then tried to take him into custody by deploying a taser but had no success.

Police said McCorvey fled on foot and jumped a fence, but he was apprehended within a short distance.

Officers attempted to arrest him a second time with the assistance of two Mobile County Sheriff's deputies as he continued to resist arrest. That's when police said an officer touch-tased him.

McCorvey was finally taken into custody, but had to be taken to the hospital for a possible cardiac event.

He later died on October 22 as a result of the cardiac event, according to police.

      The family of an East Feliciana Parish man shot dead by a sheriff's deputy responding to a burglary call early Monday said the man struggled with his mental health and, despite previous trouble with the law, didn't carry guns and didn't pose a danger to law enforcement officers.

An alarm about 2:30 a.m. Monday brought deputies to a Texaco gasoline station off La. 10, the Sheriff's Office said. When they confronted a man — identified by his family as Christopher Whitfield, 31 — he fled on foot and an unknown deputy shot him behind the gas station. The store's owner said the man had broken in and stolen raw chicken from a cooler.

East Feliciana sheriff's Chief Deputy Greg Phares confirmed that the deputy shot the burglary suspect behind the gas station, but Phares declined to say what led to him firing or if Whitfield had a weapon.

Myrtle Jackson, the dead man's grandmother, told The Advocate that Whitfield struggled to manage mental illness and said he had past legal trouble, including a few recent criminal convictions. She described her grandson as a nice person and said he didn't carry guns.

      Dean and another officer were responding to an early-morning house call after a neighbor became concerned when they noticed the front door of a home, which belonged to Jefferson's mother, was left ajar and requested a welfare check.

Jefferson had been babysitting her 8-year-old nephew inside and playing video games. According to police and body camera footage, Dean failed to identify himself before firing his weapon, striking Jefferson.

The bodycam video released publicly shows the perspective of an officer outside the home, peering into a window using a flashlight and spotting someone inside standing near a window and telling her, "Put your hands up — show me your hands." A single shot is fired seconds later.

Jefferson's nephew told authorities that she had taken a handgun from her purse when she heard noises outside and pointed it toward the window, according to an arrest warrant. But police have said she was within her rights to protect herself.

      An African-American woman named Dominique Clayton was killed in her Oxford, Mississippi home on Sunday, May 19. She was shot early that morning, in the back of the head while she slept. Her youngest son, Jadarius, found her body later that night. It took the city of Oxford two days to arrest Matthew Kinne, a white Oxford police officer, and charge him with the murder. The Oxford Police Department fired Kinne that same day, Tuesday, May 21.

      Turner, 44, was shot around 10:40 p.m. by the officer trying to arrest her at an apartment complex in Baytown, about 25 miles east of Houston, Lt. Steve Dorris, a Baytown police spokesman, said.

Authorities said the officer was patrolling the area and was "forced to draw his weapon and fire multiple rounds" after Turner grabbed his stun gun and used it on him. She was pronounced dead at the scene, police said.

Turner's family said at a news conference Thursday that she suffered from schizophrenia, after having been diagnosed with the mental illness many years ago.

Civil rights attorney Benjamin Crump, who is representing the family, said Turner was picking up trash in the neighborhood and putting it in dumpsters the night she was fatally shot, something he said she often did.

      On September 6, 2018, off-duty Dallas Police Department patrol officer Amber Guyger entered the Dallas, Texas, apartment of 26-year-old accountant Botham Jean and fatally shot him. Guyger said that she had entered the apartment believing it was her own and that she shot Jean believing he was a burglar.[1][2] The fact that Guyger, a white police officer, shot and killed Jean, an unarmed black man, and was initially only charged with manslaughter, resulted in protests and accusations of racial bias.[3][4][5] On October 1, 2019, Guyger was found guilty of murder.[6] The next day, she received a sentence of ten years in prison.[7

      On Tuesday June 19, 2018, there was a drive-by shooting in North Braddock around 8:30 p.m. Just 10 minutes later, police stopped a car matching witness descriptions of the silver Chevrolet Cruze used in the drive-by shooting. The police observed bullet holes on the side of the car.[10]

A video recording taken by a bystander shows police ordering the driver to step out from the car.[10] While the driver was being handcuffed, Rose and the third occupant, Zaijuan Hester, attempted to evade arrest by running from the car.[11] Rosfeld fired three rounds, and Rose was struck by all three.[11] He was pronounced dead at McKeesport Hospital.[3]

In the video, a woman's voice is heard saying, "Why they shooting at him? All they did was run, and they shooting at them." [sic] [2] Police said that Rose had been unarmed when he was shot.[11] Hester escaped, but was later arrested.[12]

      In the late evening of March 18, 2018, Stephon Clark, a 22-year-old African-American man, was shot and killed in Meadowview, Sacramento, California by Terrence Mercadal and Jared Robinet, two officers of the Sacramento Police Department in the backyard of his grandmother's house while he had a phone in his hand. The encounter was filmed by police video cameras and by a Sacramento County Sheriff's Department helicopter which was involved in observing Clark, on the ground and in directing ground officers to the point at which the shooting took place. The officers stated that they shot Clark, firing 20 rounds, believing that he had pointed a gun at them. Police found only a cell phone on him. While the Sacramento County Coroner's autopsy report concluded that Clark was shot seven times, including three shots to the right side of the back, the pathologist hired by the Clark family stated that Clark was shot eight times, including six times in the back.

The shooting caused large protests in Sacramento, and Clark's family members have rejected the initial police description of the events leading to Clark's death. The Sacramento Police Department placed the officers on paid administrative leave and opened a use of force investigation. Police have stated they are confident that Clark was the suspect responsible for breaking windows in the area prior to the encounter.

On March 2, 2019, the Sacramento County district attorney announced that the Sacramento police officers who killed Clark would not be charged and that they had probable cause to stop Clark and were legally justified in the use of deadly force.[1][2]

      The city released body camera footage Monday showing a police officer fatally shooting a man he was trying to stop for a minor traffic infraction, after the two struggled along a pathway in February 2018.

The nearly 13-minutes of audio and video, released in response to several records requests under a new transparency law, shows the brief interaction between Ronell Foster and Vallejo police Officer Ryan McMahon after the officer chased Foster behind a building along Carolina Street. Only the last 90 seconds or so contain raw footage of the shooting, some of which is muted because of a normal audio delay.

McMahon did not activate his body camera until after he shot Foster, though he had used a stun gun on Foster before the shooting, police said.

McMahon also was one of six officers who shot and killed 20-year-old Willie McCoy as he sat in the front seat of his car near a local drive-through restaurant last February, a shooting that has led to public outcry and legal action by McCoy’s family.

      Bailey, 45, was shot and killed June 29, 2017, by two Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department officers following a late-night traffic stop and brief vehicle pursuit that ended in Bailey crashing his vehicle.


The officers, Michal P. Dinnsen and Carlton J. Howard, fired 11 shots into the side and back of the vehicle. They said they saw Bailey reaching toward the center console, where they feared a gun may have been stored. 

Four of the rounds struck Bailey in the back. No gun was found. His death inflamed tensions among local police and concerned citizens who saw Bailey's death as an act of injustice that threatened the legitimacy of the police department

      ccording to initial reports, the officers were responding around 11:00 p.m. to a 911 call "reporting several underage kids drunk walking around" at a party of approximately 100 people.[1][2][5] Upon arrival, the officers allegedly heard gunshots, which created panic and caused party-goers to flee. Officer Roy Oliver fired three rifle rounds into a vehicle, striking Edwards in the head and killing him.[1][2][4] Oliver was reportedly armed with a Modern Carbine MC5 rifle.[8] Along with Edwards, the car contained two of Edwards's brothers and two friends.[9] Edwards's 16-year-old brother was driving the car.[9] Lee Merritt, a lawyer for Edwards's family, said Oliver shot through the front passenger side window.[10][11] Edwards was pronounced dead at a local hospital.[10] According to police, Edwards's brother was held in police custody overnight for the purpose of questioning him as a witness.[4]

Police originally said there was an "unknown altercation with a vehicle backing down the street towards the officers in an aggressive manner".[1][2] After reviewing body cam footage, Police Chief Jonathan Haber later admitted that the vehicle was not moving toward the officers, but rather away from them.[3][5][12] Haber said he had "misspoke", saying, "I was unintentionally incorrect yesterday when I said that the victim's vehicle was backing down the road."[5] A later statement by the police department said, "The vehicle then pulled forward as the officer continued to approach the vehicle giving verbal commands. The vehicle continued [on] the main roadway driving away from the officer as an officer shot into the vehicle striking the passenger."[3]

Oliver was fired from the police department as a result of the shooting.[4] He had been a member of the Balch Springs Police Department for six years.[5]`,

      The night before she was killed, Alteria Woods had went to see the movie “Get Out” with her mother. She then attended the county fair.

Yolanda Woods said she thought her daughter went to her own home in Gifford after the fair. Instead, Alteria Woods stopped by Coffee’s home. By 6 a.m., deputies were outside getting ready to conduct the drug raid.

Witnesses would later say it was unclear who fired the first shot. Woods was struck while lying on a bed inside the home, officials said.

Deputies arrested Coffee and his father, Andrew Coffee III, in the raid. In a news conference after the shooting, Sheriff Deryl Loar said Woods was struck by “one of the rounds” fired by deputies.

But, Yolanda Woods said the sheriff’s office put out a number of false details, something that hurt her as she grieved the loss of her daughter.

Alteria Woods’ death certificate showed she died of multiple gunshot wounds. Yolanda Woods said sheriff’s officials said her daughter was pregnant and that Coffee used her as a human shield.

However, Alteria Woods’ death certificate showed she was not pregnant. Loar has not explained the basis for the statement on Coffee using Alteria Woods as a human shield.

The three officers who fired shots, Sgt. Patrick White, Detective Christopher Reeve and Officer Richard Sarcinello, were originally put on administrative leave. The deputies later returned to work.

Yolanda Woods said body camera footage could have been crucial in leading deputies to be charged. The sheriff’s office does not have body cameras, only dashboard cameras, said sheriff’s spokesman Maj. Eric Flowers.
